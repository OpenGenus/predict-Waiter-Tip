# predict-Waiter-s-Tip
In the bustling world of restaurants and bars, understanding customer behavior is crucial. One particular challenge faced by waitstaff is predicting tips accurately. Predicting tips aids in service optimization, leading to satisfied customers and a thriving business. Here is a python program for predicting how much a waiter might earn in tips on a particular day. 
The modules used here are pandas and scikit-learn and we are reading data from a csv file named 'dataset.csv'.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

### Installation
Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/OpenGenus/predict-Waiter-Tip.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd predict-Waiter-s-Tip`

Install the required packages:

`pip install pandas scikit-learn`

### Usage

Run the prediction script using the following command:

`python waiter_tip.py`

This script reads data from the 'dataset.csv' file, trains a linear regression model, and predicts the tip for a new set of inputs.
